          <ul>
            <li>
              Discovery of Radioactivity: Marie Curie, along with her husband
              Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, discovered radioactivity in 1896
              while studying uranium. This groundbreaking discovery
              revolutionized the understanding of atomic structure and laid the
              foundation for subsequent advancements in nuclear physics and
              chemistry. For this work, Marie Curie was awarded the Nobel Prize
              in Physics in 1903, making her the first woman to win a Nobel
              Prize.
            </li>
            <li>
              Isolation of Radium and Polonium: Building upon their discovery of
              radioactivity, Marie Curie and her husband Pierre Curie embarked
              on the challenging task of isolating radioactive elements from
              uranium ores. Through meticulous experimentation, they succeeded
              in isolating two new elements: radium and polonium. This
              achievement not only expanded the periodic table but also opened
              doors to further research on the properties and applications of
              radioactive elements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pioneering Research in Radiation Therapy: Marie Curie's research
              laid the groundwork for the use of radiation in medicine. During
              World War I, she led efforts to equip ambulances with X-ray
              equipment, which proved invaluable in diagnosing injuries on the
              battlefield. Additionally, Curie's work paved the way for the
              development of radiation therapy for cancer treatment, a
              significant advancement in the fight against this disease.
