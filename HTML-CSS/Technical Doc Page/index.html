            Python is a computer programming language often used to build
            websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis.
            Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to
            create a variety of different programs and isn’t specialized for any
            specific problems. This versatility, along with its
            beginner-friendliness, has made it one of the most-used programming
            languages today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stack Overflow's 2022 Developer Survey revealed that Python is the
            fourth most popular programming language, with respondents saying
            that they use Python almost 50 percent of the time in their
            development work. Survey results also showed that Python is tied
            with Rust as the most-wanted technology, with 18% percent of
            developers who aren't using it already saying that they are
            interested in learning Python

            Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task
            automation, data analysis, and data visualization. Since it’s
            relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many
            non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of
            everyday tasks, like organizing finances.

            “Writing programs is a very creative and rewarding activity,” says
            University of Michigan and Coursera instructor Charles R Severance
            in his book Python for Everybody. “You can write programs for many
            reasons, ranging from making your living to solving a difficult data
            analysis problem to having fun to helping someone else solve a
            problem.”

          <p>
            Printing "Hello World" is the first program in Python. This program
            will not take any user input, it will just print "Hello World" on
            the output screen. It is used to test if the software needed to
            compile and run the program has been installed correctly.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Install Python. Make sure that Python is installed on your system
              or not. If Python is not installed, then install it from
              <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Choose Text Editor or IDE to write the code.</li>
            <li>
              Open Text Editor or IDE, create a new file, and write the code to
              print Hello World.
            </li>
            <li>Save the file with a file name and extension ".py".</li>
            <li>Compile/Run the program.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3 class="section-subtitle">Python Program to Print Hello World</h3>
          <p>
            Consider the below code that will print "Hello World" or any message
            that you will write inside the print() method on the screen.
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
              # Python code to print "Hello World"<br />
              print ("Hello World")
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            In the above code, we wrote two lines. The first line is the Python
            comment that will be ignored by the Python interpreter, and the
            second line is the print() statement that will print the given
            message ("Hello World") on the output screen.

          <p>
            Python variables are the reserved memory locations used to store
            values with in a Python Program. This means that when you create a
            variable you reserve some space in the memory. Based on the data
            type of a variable, Python interpreter allocates memory and decides
            what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning
            different data types to Python variables, you can store integers,
            decimals or characters in these variables.
          </p>
          <h3 class="section-subtitle">Creating Variables</h3>
          <p>
            Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory
            space or you can say to create a variable. A Python variable is
            created automatically when you assign a value to it. The equal sign
            (=) is used to assign values to variables.
          </p>
          <p>
            The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the
            variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value
            stored in the variable. For example
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
              counter = 100 <br />
              miles = 1000.0 <br />
              name = "Zara Ali"
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            This example creates different types (an integer, a float, and a
            string) of variables.
          </p>
          <h3 class="section-subtitle">Deleting Python Variables</h3>
          <p>
            You can delete the reference to a number object by using the del
            statement. The syntax of the del statement is −
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>del var1[,var2[,var3[....,varN]]]] </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            You can delete a single object or multiple objects by using the del
            statement. For example −
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
              del var <br />
              del var_a, var_b
            </code>
          </div>
          <h3 class="section-subtitle">Getting Type of a Variable</h3>
          <p>
            You can get the data type of a Python variable using the python
            built-in function type() as follows.
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
              x = "Zara" <br />
              y = 10 <br />
              z = 10.10 <br />
              <br />
              print(type(x)) <br />
              print(type(y)) <br />
              print(type(z))
            </code>
          </div>
          <h3 class="section-subtitle">Casting Python Variables</h3>
          <p>
            You can specify the data type of a variable with the help of casting
            as follows:
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
              x = str(10) <br />
              y = int(10) <br />
              z = float(10) <br />
              <br />
              print( "x =", x ) <br />
              print( "y =", y ) <br />
              print( "z =", z )
            </code>
          </div>
          <h3 class="section-subtitle">Case-Sensitivity of Python Variables</h3>
          <p>
            Python variables are case sensitive which means Age and age are two
            different variables:
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
              age = 20 <br />
              Age = 30 <br />
              <br />
              print( "age =", age ) <br />
              print( "Age =", Age )
            </code>
          </div>
          <h3 class="section-subtitle">
            Python Variables - Multiple Assignment
          </h3>
          <p>
            Python allows to initialize more than one variables in a single
            statement. In the following case, three variables have same value.
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
              >>> a=10 <br />
              >>> b=10 <br />
              >>> c=10 <br />
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            Instead of separate assignments, you can do it in a single
            assignment statement as follows −
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
              >>> a=b=c=10 <br />
              >>> print (a,b,c) <br />
              10 10 10
            </code>
          </div>
          <h3 class="section-subtitle">Python Variables - Naming Convention</h3>
          <p>
            Every Python variable should have a unique name like a, b, c. A
            variable name can be meaningful like color, age, name etc. There are
            certain rules which should be taken care while naming a Python
            variable:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore
              character
            </li>
            <li>
              A variable name cannot start with a number or any special
              character like $, (, * % etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and
              underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
            </li>
            <li>
              Python variable names are case-sensitive which means Name and NAME
              are two different variables in Python.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python reserved keywords cannot be used naming the variable.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
          <header><h1 class="section-title">Data Types</h1></header>
          <p>
            A data type represents a kind of value and determines what
            operations can be done on it. Numeric, non-numeric and Boolean
            (true/false) data are the most obvious data types. However, each
            programming language has its own classification largely reflecting
            its programming philosophy.
